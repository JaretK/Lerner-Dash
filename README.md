# Lerner Dash - CCLCM Chrome Extension
### Contains useful tools for CCLCM students (and CCF staff in general):
* auto log in to library resources
* auto log in to academic paper resources (on pubmed, etc)
* auto log in to ScienceDirect articles (no more searching for the little sciencedirect button!)
* highlight and search text on up to date, pubmed, access medicine, and clinicalkey
* useful links for looking up medical knowledge

### Use:
* Press the browser action button (the blue briefcase with a cross in the middle) to open the popup
* Press ctrl + shift + F to open the popup as well
* Press ENTER with no query or click outside the popup to close the popup
* Type a query into the query box and press ENTER to search with the default search engine, or click one of the supported search engines below the query box
* The default search engine can be changed by clicking the logo (corresponding to the current search engine) and selecting a different logo from the selection. This selection is saved.
* The Moodle course ID can be changed by pressing TAB or clicking the text box next to "course id=". Clicking the moodle link will take you to the selected course. Clicking moodle without a course ID will take you to the default moodle page. A moodle course ID can be found by going to the moodle link for a course and looking at the URL, which should look something like this at the login page: https://mdl.cclcm.ccf.org/enrol/index.php?id=XYZ, where XYZ is the current course ID. Type that number into the course ID page. Click the moodle link again to save the course ID to the program. 
* Highlight text on any page and click the "Lerner Dash" context menu. Click on any of the search engines to search the text in that engine.
